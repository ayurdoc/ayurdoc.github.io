### Introduction
To understand the menstrual cycle diet, you should know the three phases which we come across during the menstrual cycle. They are:
+ Menstrual phase/Follicular phase
+ Ovulation phase
+ Luteal phase

Each phase has different hormonal effects on the body and mind. This variation in the hormone level during each phase will help the follicle (egg) to develop, mature, and ovulate (release an egg from ovaries). When there is no fertilization of an egg (no pregnancy), all hormonal levels decrease and the inner lining of the uterus sheds off, causing bleeding from the vagina.

### Benefit of Menstrual cycle Diet and Exercise
Hormones play a vital role in regularising the cycles. Eating has a lot to do with your menstrual health. Following the right diet and exercise can bring a wide range of health benefits, as well as balance to your hormones and helps in reducing menstrual cramps, regulate your cycle, and reduce premenstrual symptoms.

### Menstrual cycle Diet
The below table tells what food supports your hormones and cycles.

+ When you see the table - most of the fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, chicken, fish milk, and milk products are rich in iron, magnesium, vitamins, zinc, protein, calcium, fiber which is very much essential not only for balancing your hormones, but also improves the general health condition. Therefore, having a balanced diet is of prime importance. 
+ Junk foods like a salted snack, sweetened carbonated beverages, bakery products, biscuits are high in salt, sugar, fat, calories, and low in nutrients. These are the contributing factors for painful periods, irregular cycles, and premenstrual symptoms like headache, bloating of the abdomen, constipation, lack of concentration, weight gain, irritability, mood swings. 
+ Drinking 2-3 liters of water is recommended.
+ Studies show that Vitamin D plays a critical role in reproductive health, mood regulation and also reduces the risk of PMS.
+ Every individual is unique throughout their menstrual cycle, hence it is advised to observe the cycle and look out for patterns. 
+ Along with a balanced diet, physical activity is much needed.

### Ayurvedic perceptive 
+ In Ayurvedic text, there are a lot of references regarding the Rutuchakra (menstrual cycle) and Stree Roga (all gynaecological disorders). In Rajaswalacharya (mode of living during menstruation) says that during the first 3 days of menstruation, females should take rest and should include Shali rice or Barley with cow ghee and milk in her meal for those 3 days. 
+ One should also avoid food which has a property of Katu (Hot/Khara/Theeka), Tikshna (Pungent) and Lavana (Salty) during the menstruation.
+ We can also find a reference that says, food should be cooked and consumed in utensils made of clay or iron. Cooking of food in non-stick utensils or aluminium utensils has to be avoided. Studies suggest that non-stick and aluminium utensils release toxins and are harmful to human health. 
+ Regular physical activity like exercise/yoga will help you reduce menstrual cramps, balances the hormones, reduces premenstrual symptoms.  
+ Massage your abdomen and back using sesame oil/castor oil/ coconut oil for 10mins and take fomentation using a hot bag will help relieve abdominal cramps.
 


### Few home remedies to ease the flow
+ Soak 10 grams of coriander seeds in 250ML of warm water. Keep it overnight. Consume the water on an empty stomach in the morning every day.
+ Soak 5 grams of fenugreek seeds overnight in 250ML of warm water. Consume the water on an empty stomach in the morning every day.+ Add crushed fresh ginger into boiling water. Boil it for 2-5 minutes and consume this water.
+ Add 20 grams of cumin seeds to 2 liters of water. Boil it. Keep drinking this water throughout the day. 
+ Take 1tsp of ghee (clarified butter) in one glass of hot water. Consume it on an empty stomach, one hour prior to breakfast. Doing this every day for 3 months will ease the flow. This is also very effective in case of painful menstruation. 
+ Take 1 tablespoon cumin seeds, 1/2 tablespoon pepper seeds, 2 tablespoon coriander seeds, dry roast them and grind it to a fine powder. Add this powder into 500 ml water and boil it for 2-3 minutes. Drink this water twice or thrice a day during Day 1-5 of your periods.
