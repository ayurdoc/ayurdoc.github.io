### Introduction 
If your little one is growing up and approaching puberty, she is likely to feel anxious about her bodily changes. As menstruation topic is always surrounded by myths and taboo which impact girl's and women’s mental and emotional health and also her lifestyle. Talking about periods can make parents and kids feel awkward but finding a way to talk about the period in a confident manner can make a huge difference when she gets her periods. It is necessary to make them understand about puberty, menstruation, and reproductive health.

### Puberty
Puberty in girls links childhood to adulthood where there is a development of secondary sexual characters like the development of breast, hair growth around the pubis and the armpit, peak growth in height, and attaining menstruation. All these changes are completed between the age of 10 and 16 years. The onset of puberty depends on genetic, nutrition, body weight, psychological state, social and cultural background. A girl with good nutrition, adequate body weight, and whose mother and sister have early menarche (onset of first menstruation), start puberty early. If a girl exhibits any sexual characteristic before the age of 8 and starts menstruating before the age of 10 then she may need to seek a doctor to know the underlying cause for precocious puberty. Not only girls even boys need certain knowledge about periods, as boys attend puberty at the same age so it is important to educate them.

### Menstruation
Menstruation /Periods is the natural process where there is shedding of blood and other material from the inner lining of the uterus. Under the influence of hormones that are oestrogen and progesterone every month, there is proliferation (thickening) of the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) and at the end of the cycle, this lining dies and sheds off in the form of bleeding from the vagina. Once the menstruation starts, it continues every month in a cyclical pattern at the interval of 21-35 days, which means starting from the first day of the last period to the first day of the next period.  Periods may last for 4-5 days with an average blood loss of 25-55ml that is around 2-4tsp and nearly 70% of blood loss occur in the first 2 days. 
Now the most common doubt that arises in their mind is why do I get my periods? They should know that every month there is a release of an egg from the ovaries (which is a part of the uterus) and getting periods means her body prepares the uterus for the pregnancy under the effect of hormones and when a girl is not sexually active then there is no pregnancy and the preparation goes waste and there is shedding of the endometrium. That is how you get your periods every month.
So, there is nothing to feel dirty or impure when you hear about periods/menstruation and let’s talk about periods the way it is.

### Points to be remembered:
+ Girls and women should always keep a track on the last period date so this will keep her well prepared for the next period. 
+For a few girls, once they get their first period, it may be irregular and it might take about 2-3 years for a regular cycle and this is normal. 
+ After a certain age, if periods get delayed by >10 days and has an irregular pattern then she may need to see a doctor.
+ Heavy bleeding and tending to change pad within 2 hours are not normal.
+ Severe cramps and severe PMS are not normal.
+ Change pad/tampon every 4-6 hours and maintain local hygiene. 
+ Have a balanced diet and indulge yourself in the physical activity which helps to balance your hormone and thereby helps in regularising the cycle and reduces symptoms like cramps and PMS.  To know more about diet and exercise check the menstrual cycle diet and physical activity page. 
+ Indian science Ayurveda, we can find a lot of reference regarding the regimen to be followed during the menstrual cycle, normal and abnormal menstrual cycle, and its treatment. Herbs and diet mentioned in the ayurvedic texts work wonderfully in all the gynaecological disorders.
