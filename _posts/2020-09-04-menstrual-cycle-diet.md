### Introduction
To understand the menstrual cycle diet, you should know the three phases which we come across during the menstrual cycle. They are:
+ Menstrual phase/ follicular phase
+ Ovulation phase
+ Luteal phase
Each phase has a different hormonal effects on the body and mind. This variation in the hormone level during each phase will help the follicle (egg) to develop, mature, and ovulate (release an egg from ovaries). When there is no fertilization of an egg (no pregnancy) then all the hormonal levels decrease and the inner lining of the uterus is shed off and causing bleeding from the vagina. 

### Benefit of Menstrual cycle Diet and Exercise
The hormone plays a vital role in regularising the cycles. Eating has a lot to do with your menstrual health. Following the right diet and exercise can bring a wide range of health benefits as well as balance your hormones and helps in reducing menstrual cramps, regulate your cycle, reduce premenstrual symptoms, and more.

+ When you see the table- most of the fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, chicken, fish milk, and milk products are rich in iron, magnesium, vitamins, zinc, protein, calcium, fiber which is very much essential not only for balancing your hormones, but also improves the general health condition. Therefore, having a balanced diet is of prime importance.

### Ayurvedic perceptive 
+ In Ayurveda text, there are a lot of reference regarding the Rutuchakra (menstrual cycle) and Stree Roga (all gynaecological disorders). In Rajaswalacharya (mode of living during menstruation) says that during the first 3 days of menstruation, females should take rest and should include Shali rice or Barley with cow ghee and milk in her meal for those 3 days. 
+ She should also avoid food which has a property of Katu (Hot), Tikshna (Pungent) and Lavana (Salty) during the menstruation.
+ We can also find a reference that says that food should be cooked and consumed in utensils made of clay or iron. Nowadays food is cooked in the non-stick utensils or aluminium utensils, which has to be avoided. As studies suggest that non-stick and aluminium utensils can release toxins and are harmful to human health. 
+ Regular physical activity like exercise/yoga will help you reduce menstrual cramps, balance the hormones, reduces premenstrual symptoms.  
+ Massage your abdomen and back using sesame oil/castor oil/ coconut oil for 10mins and take fomentation using a hot bag will help relieve abdominal cramps.
