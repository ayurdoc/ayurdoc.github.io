Did you miss your periods? Are you wondering whether you might be pregnant? The only way to be sure is to take a pregnancy test. But there are other early signs and symptoms of pregnancy which you can look for. Sometimes, these signs of pregnancy can mimic the symptoms you have prior to your periods and it might be hard to differentiate. The most common early signs of pregnancy are:

### Missed Period
One of the classic signs of pregnancy is when you have a regular cycle and you have missed or delayed your periods.

### Spotting or Cramping
Few pregnant women might experience spotting per vagina around 10-14 days after fertilization which is called implantation bleeding. And during this implantation, women might or might not experience mild cramping pain and they get confused with the normal period. However, this bleeding and cramps are slight in the case of pregnancy.

### Morning Sickness
It usually appears early, following the missed period, and rarely lasts beyond 16 weeks. Women experience nausea with or without vomiting which can strike any time of the day. However, some women never experience it, this is because of the new pregnancy hormone flooding your body. It usually does not affect the health status of the mother. 

Occasionalsickness and slight vomiting are common in early pregnancy. However, if one experiences Hyperemesis Gravidarum, where there is severe vomiting which has a deleterious effect on the health, then they need medical attention. They may consult a doctor.

One can overcome these symptoms by avoiding fatty and spicy food and eating a healthy diet to get the essential nutrients. Keep dry toast or biscuits always with you to make sure you are never completely hungry. If these simple measures fail you can always talk to your doctor about it, where Vitamin B1 and antiemetic medication can relieve your symptoms. Also, make sure to hydrate yourself well. 

### Food Aversion
Few might be highly sensitive to various odors like foods, cooking, perfume, and a sense of taste might change leading to aversion towards food.

### Frequent Micturition
It is quite a troublesome symptom after 6- 8 weeks of pregnancy. It is due to the growing uterus which puts pressure on the bladder. Few women might experience an increase in thirst and frequent urination due to changes in osmoregulation. Usually, these symptoms disappear after 12 weeks due to the straightening of the uterus. This could also be because of a Urinary tract infection. If you have a burning sensation and pain during urination, then consult your doctor.

### Breast Discomfort 
Due to hormonal effect in the body, there are a few changes seen in the breast in the form of feeling fullness, tenderness, and pricking sensation. The nipple and areola become more pigmented which are evident as early as 6th-8th week, especially if it’s your first pregnancy. This discomfort decreases gradually. 

### Fatigue
The first few weeks of pregnancy can make you feel extremely tired physically and emotionally. Due to the changes in your body, such as an increase in the production of blood, a decrease in blood sugar level, a decrease in blood pressure making, you feel sick and tired. Get plenty of rest and have a healthy diet to overcome this fatigue.
 
### Mood Swing
Mood swing is a common sign of pregnancy due to changing hormones. It can make you unusually emotional, irritable, anxious, or stressed. 

### Bloating/Constipation
Due to an increase in progesterone hormone, there is a decrease in gut motility which can cause bloating or constipation. Have food rich in fiber and drink plenty of water, which can ease your symptoms. 

### Headache and Dizziness
Few women might experience mild headaches and dizziness, this might be related to the dilatation of the blood vessels, low blood sugar level, or low blood pressure. 

### Rise in Basal Body Temperature
After ovulation, due to progesterone hormone, there is a slight increase in the basal body temperature and remains constant until the next period. But if conceived, this raised basal body temperature remains elevated. 

Each woman might experience her pregnancy journey in a unique way. Even the same woman might have different symptoms from one pregnancy to the next. The best way to confirm is to take a pregnancy test and through the ultrasound. If you have confirmed your pregnancy by yourself, then consult a doctor for an early pregnancy checkup. And if the test is negative and still experience the above signs and symptoms, repeat the pregnancy test after one week or visit a doctor. This may be because many early symptoms are similar to pre-menstrual disorders.
