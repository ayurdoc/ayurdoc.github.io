### Introduction
Many girls and women suffer from period pain, in medical terms it is called Dysmenorrhoea, which defines as painful menstruation to a sufficient extent that it interferes with day-to-day activities. Due to its high prevalence, it has been a major concern for many girls and women out there. We can see that it affects widely, ranging from 45% to 93% of women of reproductive age, and the highest rates are reported in adolescents. 

You might be wondering why do many females experience pain during periods. It is very simple to understand about this pain theory. Let us take an example of a wet sponge. When a wet sponge has to be dried, you may have to drain the water off by squeezing the sponge and the sponge would be dry. Now it is ready to be soaked in water again. In the similar way during menstruation, the body has to squeeze the uterus to shed the endometrium (inner the lining of the uterus) causing bleeding from the vagina and this squeeze is nothing but contraction which can be with or without pain.

Before we jump into the methods that will help in relieving the pain, it is important to understand the types and causes of dysmenorrhoea for the treatment plan. 

### Types of dysmenorrhoea  
We have two types of dysmenorrhea
+ <b>Primary Dysmenorrhoea</b> - there is no identifiable pelvic pathology. 
+ <b>Secondary Dysmenorrhoea</b> - there is the presence of pelvic pathology (any disease or abnormality related to the pelvis)  

### Causes
In this table let us understand the causes for dysmenorrhoea
#### Causes of Primary Dysmenorrhoea

| Causes| Leads to |
| :------ | :------- |
| Maximum production of prostaglandin hormone | Increase in myometrial contraction causing pain. |
| Abnormal structural and functional defect of the uterus like uterine hypoplasia (small size uterus), under-development of Mullerian ducts, stenosis of internal os (narrow passage at the outlet) | Causing hyperactivity of the {::nomarkdown} <span class="definition" title="middle layer of the uterus" >myometrium</span>{:/}(middle layer of the uterus) |
| Increase the production of other hormones like vasopressin, endothelin, leukotrienes | Can also cause pain |

Due to the above-mentioned causative factors, many girls and women experience painful menstruation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, fainting, headache, exhaustion, and lethargy. This kind of painful menstruation can be managed with proper diet, exercise, simple herbs, and ayurvedic panchakarma therapies. 

### Management - Ayurveda
Most of the time painful menstruation and PMS can be treated by following a simple [Menstrual Cycle Diet](/what-to-eat-and-what-to-avoid-during-menstrual-cycle) and with some exercise. In few cases, the use of herbs and therapy would be required. 

In Ayurveda, we have a reference for Dysmenorrhea as Udavarta Yonivyapath and Kastartava as a symptom in many gynaecological disorders. Considering this, treatment is planned in terms of dietary modulation, medications, and therapy.

#### Diet
Ayurveda has emphasized on the use of meat soup, fish, Use of Shali Rice, barley, milk, and ghee in the meal and regular use of cumin, coriander seeds, pepper, long pepper, garlic, carom seeds, asafoetida in the food. These foods are rich in omega-3 fatty acid, Iron, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, E, K, and these spices mentioned have an anti-inflammatory property and also relieves pain. 

A decoction prepared out of Shunti, Pippali, Mustha, Brahathi, Paatala herbs mixed with jaggery and curd, should be given for one week during menstruation. 

Decoction prepared out of 10grams of Dasamula Churna in 300ml of water and 100ml of milk, boil till it reduces to 3/4th. This is called as Dasamula Ksheerapaka. It is one of the best remedies for relieving pain.
